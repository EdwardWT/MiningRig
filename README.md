HASHRATE MARKETPLACE
Choose from thousands of real rigs available to lease and mine for you. Whether you're wanting to mine Bitcoin or a brand new alt-coin, mining is just a couple clicks away.

EARN MORE
List your own hardware and earn more than mining directly. You never have to monitor pricing or find the new hot coin to mine as you will always be competitively priced and paid by us.

CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING RIGS
A mining rig is a collection of specialised computing devices that use math hashing algorithms to secure a cryptocurrency network and generate coins as a reward to the miner.

# What We Offer
Algorithms
We offer the largest selection available, with over 100+ different mining algorithms. You can mine practically -any- coin you want.

Analytics
With our detailed graphs and worker monitoring, you will get instant feedback on the status of your mining hashpower.

Pool Choice
Configure your rig or rental like the professionals do. There are absolutely no imposed limitations on which pools you can use. We support all stratum based mining pools.

Pool Manager
With our web-based pool manager, you can control your rig or your rental from -anywhere-. You can enter up to 5 pools at a time for failover capabilities, and swap between them at any time.
